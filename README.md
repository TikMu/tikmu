This is the central repository for the development of the TikMu app.

As of 2016, TikMu is no longer being developed.


## Building and running

To build TikMu, it is necessary a recent development branch version of
HaxeFoundation/haxe and some haxelibs.  The full list can be seen at
[`.robrt.Dockerfile`](.robrt.Dockerfile), which is directly used by our _new_
live build system.

Additionally, Mongodb and Tora are required at runtime.
