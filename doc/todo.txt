To-do list
==========

 - Begin with tag: subsystem, feature or other meaningful word
 - Add a short description after ": "
 - Add more details in parenthesis
 - To assign Mark (user mrk), append @mrk
 - Assigned tasks should not be taken without coordination with the assignee
 - All other tasks are open

Auth: create /logout/force with openRoute meta (how does mweb handle subdispatching again?)
Auth: fix broken/old "is user authenticated" (use ctx.session.isAuthenticated())
Web: make 'Menu' a proper route (drop the 'authenticated' parameter)
