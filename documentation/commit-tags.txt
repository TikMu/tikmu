Commit and issue tags are used to roughly indicate the scope of a change.  The
following tags are currently being used:

API: application programming interface; includes routes, for now
Auth: authorization and authentication system (register, login, session, ...)
CI: self updating server, its build script and its GitHub listener
Cleanup: clean or remove old/bad code
Fix: fix of a bug or issue (official or not)
Impl: implementation change that should not have visible side effects for users or the db
Minor: changes that have little or no effect on the code execution
UI: user interface
