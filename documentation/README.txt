following tags are currently being used:

    Auth:  authorization and authentication system (register, login, session, ...)
      CI:  self updating server, its build script and its GitHub listener
 Cleanup:  clean or remove old/bad code
    Docs:  documentation
  Effect:  reputation and notification systems
     Fix:  fix of a bug or issue (official or not)
    Impl:  implementation change that should not have visible side effects for users or the db
   Minor:  changes that have little or no effect on the code execution
    Tool:  auxiliary tool
      UI:  user interface

Older or deprecated tags:

     Rep:  reputation system
  Voting:  changes required to implement answer up and downvoting
